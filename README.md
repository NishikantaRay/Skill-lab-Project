# Problem Statement:
Currently in AICTE Event/Activity Management happens manually. Such 
examples of activities that happen manually are Booking of meeting room
/auditorium, communication to all the bureaus /members regarding meetings 
through email and SMS alerts, intimate canteen for refreshment /Lunch
/dinner arrangements, update the information on AICTE social media like 
Facebook & Twitter page, Report generation, activity log checking etc. 
This manual process generally takes a lot of time to implement and can cause 
delay to the actual work. 
With the fast growing network of AICTE, it needs to automate its process to 
provide ease to manual work. 
This can highly increase in economic growth of AICTE and manage all events 
very smoothly with all information to have directed to one single portal.
# Summary Problem Statement:
• Due to manually management of Events AICTE faces a lot of challenges 
where they lose a lot of time to gather all the events together. 
• Create a common portal for all AICTE Event/Activity management would 
ease you their work and make the work process robust and flexible. 
• This will ensure AICTE to have all events under one umbrella from where 
the management would be easy and comfortable.
# Objective:

will initiate the event by deciding on the following point: 
• List of various committees (including members)

# Required features in the portal would be as follows:

• Communication to all the bureaus/members regarding meetings through 
email and SMS alerts /- mail them, SMS Twilio API. 
• A separate interface to intimate canteen for refreshment/Lunch/dinner 
arrangements // real time update page // or // Send SMS/Email to canteen 
head //, admin send notification food count, food type north south east west, 
lunch/dinner/refreshments
